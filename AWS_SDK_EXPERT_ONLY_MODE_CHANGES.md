# AWS SDK Expert - Only Mode Implementation

## Summary

Successfully transformed Continue into a dedicated AWS SDK Expert tool by:

1. Removing all other modes (Chat, Plan, Agent)
2. Making AWS SDK Expert the only and default mode
3. Updating config name from "Local Config" to "AWS SDK Expert"
4. Simplifying the UI to show only AWS SDK Expert mode

---

## Files Modified

### 1. Type Definitions

**File:** `core/index.d.ts`

- Changed `MessageModes` type from `"chat" | "agent" | "plan" | "aws-sdk-expert"` to just `"aws-sdk-expert"`
- This enforces that only AWS SDK Expert mode exists throughout the codebase

### 2. Default Configuration Names

**Files Updated:**

- `core/config/yaml/default.ts` - Both `defaultConfigYaml` and `defaultConfigYamlJetBrains`
- `core/config/default.ts` - Main default config
- `extensions/cli/src/util/yamlConfigUpdater.ts` - CLI YAML config updater (2 locations)
- `core/config/profile/LocalProfileLoader.ts` - Profile loader title

**Changes:** All instances of `name: "Local Config"` changed to `name: "AWS SDK Expert"`

### 3. Default Mode in Session State

**File:** `gui/src/redux/slices/sessionSlice.ts`

- Changed default mode from `"agent"` to `"aws-sdk-expert"`
- This ensures all new sessions start in AWS SDK Expert mode

### 4. Mode Selector UI Simplification

**File:** `gui/src/components/ModeSelect/ModeSelect.tsx`

- **Before:** Complex dropdown with Chat, Plan, Agent, and AWS SDK Expert options with mode cycling
- **After:** Simple static label showing "AWS SDK Expert" with an info tooltip
- Removed:
  - All other mode options (Chat, Plan, Agent)
  - Mode cycling functionality (Cmd/Ctrl + . shortcut)
  - Dropdown selector
  - Warning messages for incompatible models
- Kept:
  - Mode icon display
  - Tooltip explaining the mode

### 5. System Message Selection

**File:** `gui/src/redux/util/getBaseSystemMessage.ts`

- **Before:** Complex logic to select between Chat, Plan, Agent, or AWS SDK Expert system messages
- **After:** Always returns `DEFAULT_AWS_SDK_EXPERT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE`
- Removed imports for other system messages
- Simplified logic - no mode checking needed

### 6. Tool Selection Logic

**File:** `gui/src/redux/selectors/selectActiveTools.ts`

- **Before:** Different tool sets for Chat (none), Plan (read-only), and Agent (all)
- **After:** Always returns all enabled tools (AWS SDK Expert behavior)
- Removed mode parameter from selector
- Simplified to just filter based on tool policies

---

## Behavior Changes

### Before

- 4 modes: Chat, Plan, Agent, AWS SDK Expert
- User could switch between modes
- Different tool availability per mode
- Mode cycling with Cmd/Ctrl + . shortcut
- Config showed as "Local Config"

### After

- 1 mode: AWS SDK Expert only
- No mode switching (mode is fixed)
- All tools always available
- No mode cycling shortcut
- Config shows as "AWS SDK Expert"

---

## User Experience

### What Users Will See:

1. **Config Name**: "AWS SDK Expert" instead of "Local Config" in the dropdown
2. **Mode Selector**: Static label "AWS SDK Expert" (not a dropdown)
3. **Default Behavior**: Every session automatically starts in AWS SDK Expert mode
4. **System Prompt**: Always uses AWS SDK Expert specialized prompt
5. **Tool Access**: All tools available by default (read, write, execute)

### What Users Will Notice:

- No mode switching options
- Simpler, cleaner UI
- All queries automatically interpreted as AWS SDK related
- Consistent behavior across all sessions

---

## AWS SDK Expert Mode Features (Unchanged)

The core AWS SDK Expert mode functionality remains the same:

- Interprets all queries as AWS SDK related
- Instructs agent to use Context7 MCP for latest documentation
- Provides working code examples with best practices
- Includes security considerations
- Handles errors properly with SDK-specific patterns

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:

1. **Build and run** the application
2. **Verify config name**: Check that dropdown shows "AWS SDK Expert"
3. **Check mode selector**: Should show "AWS SDK Expert" as static label (no dropdown)
4. **Test queries**: Send AWS SDK queries and verify proper responses
5. **Check new sessions**: Ensure all new sessions start in AWS SDK Expert mode
6. **Verify tools**: All tools should be available in tool policies

### Example Test Queries:

```
"How do I upload a file?"
Expected: S3 upload example

"Send a message"
Expected: SQS/SNS example

"Query a table"
Expected: DynamoDB example
```

---

## Technical Notes

### Type Safety

- TypeScript will now enforce that only `"aws-sdk-expert"` can be used as a mode
- Any code trying to use "chat", "plan", or "agent" will fail type checking

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing configs with `name: "Local Config"` will still work
- The system will use the default name "AWS SDK Expert" for new configs

### Future Modifications

If other modes need to be added back:

1. Update `MessageModes` type in `core/index.d.ts`
2. Add mode options back to `ModeSelect.tsx`
3. Update `getBaseSystemMessage.ts` logic
4. Update `selectActiveTools.ts` logic
5. Add corresponding system messages in `defaultSystemMessages.ts`

## Configuration Files Not Modified

These files were intentionally not modified as they are test files or have minimal impact:

- Test files referencing "Local Config"
- Documentation files
- Migration guides
- Error messages and logs that reference "local config"

These can be updated if needed but don't affect core functionality.
